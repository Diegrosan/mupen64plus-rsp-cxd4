/*
 * Since operations on scalar registers are much more predictable,
 * standardized, and documented, we don't really need to bench those.
 *
 * I was thinking I should also add MTC0 (SP DMA and writes to SP_STATUS_REG)
 * and, due to the SSE-style flags register file, CFC2 and CTC2, but I mostly
 * just wanted to hurry up and make this header quick with all the basics. :P
 *
 * Fortunately, because all the methods are static (no conditional jumps),
 * we can lazily leave the instruction word set to 0x00000000 for all the
 * op-codes we are benching, and it will make no difference in speed.
